,What Should My Students be Reading?,Literary and Information Texts,"Students should be reading a balance of Literary and Informational texts.  Based upon the NAEP model, in K-5, the Standards follow NAEP’s lead in balancing the reading of literature with the reading of informational texts, including texts in history/social studies, science, and technical subjects. In accord with NAEP’s growing emphasis on informational texts in the higher grades, the Standards demand that a significant amount of reading of informational texts take place in and outside the ELA classroom. Fulfilling the Standards for 6-12 ELA requires much greater attention to a specific category of informational text—literary nonfiction—than has been traditional. ",Core Standards,http://www.corestandards.org/,
,What Should My Students be Reading?,Texts of Sufficient Complexity,"CCR requires that students must be able to comprehend texts of steadily increasing complexity as they progress through school. By the time they complete the core, students must be able to read and comprehend independently and proficiently the kinds of complex texts commonly found in college and careers.",Core Standards,http://www.corestandards.org/,
,What Should My Students be Reading?,Text Complexity:  A Three Part model,"Text complexity consists of three equally important parts. 

(1) Qualitative Dimensions of Text Complexity:   Qualitative dimensions and qualitative factors refer to those aspects of text complexity best measured or only measurable by an attentive human reader, such as levels of meaning or purpose; structure; language conventionality and clarity; and knowledge demands. 

(2) Quantitative Dimensions of Text Complexity:  The terms quantitative dimensions and quantitative factors refer to those aspects of text complexity, such as word length or frequency, sentence length, and text cohesion, that are difficult if not impossible for a human reader to evaluate efficiently, especially in long texts, and are thus today typically measured by computer software. 

(3) Reader and Task Consideration:  While the prior two elements of the model focus on the inherent complexity of text, variables specific to particular readers (such as motivation, knowledge, and experiences) and to particular tasks (such as purpose and the complexity of the task assigned and the questions posed) must also be considered when determining whether a text is appropriate for a given student. Such assessments are best made by teachers employing their professional judgment, experience, and knowledge of their students and the subject.",Core Standards,http://www.corestandards.org/,
,What Should My Students be Reading?,Text Complexity: Quantitative Measures,"Quantitative measures should identify the college- and career-ready reading level as one endpoint of the scale. MetaMetrics, for example, has realigned its Lexile ranges to match the Standards’ text complexity grade bands and has adjusted upward its trajectory of reading comprehension development through the grades to indicate that all students should be reading at the college and career readiness level by no later than the end of high school. 

Note: While quantitative measures of complexity are deemed important, the recent trend has been to view qualitative measures as more important in defining overall text complexity",Core Standards,http://www.corestandards.org/,
,What Literacy Skills do My Students Need to Master?,Early Grades,"For students in grade K - 5 the focus is on mastery of Foundation Skills.  These skills include understanding and working knowledge of concepts of print, the alphabetic principle, and other basic conventions of the English writing system.",Core Standards,http://www.corestandards.org/,
,What Literacy Skills do My Students Need to Master?,Middle-Upper Grade Levels,"Beginning in grade 6, the literacy standards allow teachers of ELA, history/social studies, science, and technical subjects to use their content area expertise to help students meet the particular challenges of reading, writing, speaking, listening, and language in their respective fields.",Core Standards,http://www.corestandards.org/,
,What Should My Students be Writing?,Types of Compositions,"Student writing needs to balance between the focus of the composition.  Based upon the NAEP framework, writing must cultivate the development of three mutually reinforcing writing capacities: writing to persuade, to explain, and to convey real or imagined experience. ",Core Standards,http://www.corestandards.org/,
,How Does the Mastery of Literary Skills Progress?,Anchor Standards:  An Overview,"The CCR standards anchor the document and define general, cross-disciplinary literacy expectations that must be met for students to be prepared to enter college and workforce training programs ready to succeed.   Students advancing through the grades are expected to meet each year’s grade-specific standards, retain or further develop skills and understandings mastered in preceding grades, and work steadily toward meeting the more general expectations.",Core Standards,http://www.corestandards.org/,
,How Does the Mastery of Literary Skills Progress?,Anchor Standards:  Reading,"To build a foundation for college and career readiness, students must read widely and deeply from among a broad range of high-quality, increasingly challenging literary and informational texts. Through extensive reading of stories, dramas, poems, and myths from diverse cultures and different time periods, students gain literary and cultural knowledge as well as familiarity with various text structures and elements. By reading texts in history/social studies, science, and other disciplines, students build a foundation of knowledge in these fields that will also give them the background to be better readers in all content areas. Students can only gain this foundation when the curriculum is intentionally and coherently structured to develop rich content knowledge within and across grades. Students also acquire the habits of reading independently and closely, which are essential to their future success.

The key strands that anchor Reading skills across grade level include:  (a) Key Ideas and Details; (b) Craft and Structure; (c) Integration of Knowledge and Ideas; and (d) Range of Reading and Level of Text Complexity",Core Standards,http://www.corestandards.org/,
,How Does the Mastery of Literary Skills Progress?,Anchor Standards:  Writing,"To build a foundation for college and career readiness, students need to learn to use writing as a way of offering and supporting opinions, demonstrating understanding of the subjects they are studying, and conveying real and imagined experiences and events. They learn to appreciate that a key purpose of writing is to communicate clearly to an external, sometimes unfamiliar audience, and they begin to adapt the form and content of their writing to accomplish a particular task and purpose. They develop the capacity to build knowledge on a subject through research projects and to respond analytically to literary and informational sources. To meet these goals, students must devote significant time and effort to writing, producing numerous pieces over short and extended time frames throughout the year.

The key strands that anchor Writing skills across grade level include:  (a) Text Types and Purposes; (b) Production and Distribution of Writing; (c)  Research to Build and Present Knowledge; and (d) Range of Writing",Core Standards,http://www.corestandards.org/,
,How Does the Mastery of Literary Skills Progress?,Anchor Standards:  Speaking and Listening,"To build a foundation for college and career readiness, students must have ample opportunities to take part in a variety of rich, structured conversations—as part of a whole class, in small groups, and with a partner. Being productive members of these conversations requires that students contribute accurate, relevant information; respond to and develop what others have said; make comparisons and contrasts; and analyze and synthesize a multitude of ideas in various domains.

The key strands that anchor Speaking and Listening skills across grade level include:  (a) Comprehension and Collaboration; and (b) Presentaiton of Knowledge and Ideas",,,
,How Does the Mastery of Literary Skills Progress?,Anchor Standards:  Language,"To build a foundation for college and career readiness in language, students must gain control over many conventions of standard English grammar, usage, and mechanics as well as learn other ways to use language to convey meaning effectively. They must also be able to determine or clarify the meaning of grade-appropriate words encountered through listening, reading, and media use; come to appreciate that words have nonliteral meanings, shadings of meaning, and relationships to other words; and expand their vocabulary in the course of studying content. 

The key strands that anchor Language skills across grade level include:  (a) Conventions of Standard English; (b)  Knowledge of Lanbguage; and (c) Vocabulary Acquisition and Use",,,
,Are We Again Just Looking at a New Set of Standards?,Over Arching Shifts,"The focus on college and Career Readiness requires significant shifts in the way that teachers engage their students in the learning process.  Further, students are expected to shift their own learning paradigms, engaging in more collaborative learning with their fellow students.  Because students cannot improve their reading, writing or discussion skills by listening to a teacher talk, teachers need to reverse the typical ratio of teacher talk and student work.  Students must be engaged and must be actively interacting with the teacher and other students relative to the content of the lesson, and they must be reading and writing in every classroom. Students will be expected to collaborate and engage in meaningful, productive classroom discussions centered on worthwhile content.

,Are We Again Just Looking at a New Set of Standards?,ELA/Literacy:  6 Significant Shifts,"The focus on College and Career Readiness requires more than students learning a new set of standards; it requires significant shifts in educational practice, and student learning.  For ELA and Literacy these shifts include:  

Shift 1: Balancing Informational and Literary Text:  Students read a true balance of informational and literary texts.

Shift 2: Knowledge in the Disciplines: Students build knowledge about the world (domains/ content areas) through TEXT rather than the teacher or activities.

Shift 3: Staircase of Complexity: Students read the central, grade appropriate text around which instruction is centered. Teachers are patient, create more time
and space and support in the curriculum for close reading.

Shift 4: Text-based Answers: Students engage in rich and rigorous evidence based
conversations about text.

Shift 5: Writing from Sources: Writing emphasizes use of evidence from sources to inform or make an argument.

Shift 6: Academic Vocabulary: Students constantly build the transferable vocabulary they need ",Engage NY,https://www.engageny.org/resource/common-core-shifts,
,Are We Again Just Looking at a New Set of Standards?,Math:  6 Significant Shifts,"The focus on College and Career Readiness requires more than students learning a new set of standards; it requires significant shifts in educational practice, and student learning.  For ELA and Literacy these shifts include:  

Shift 1: Focus: Teachers significantly narrow and deepen the scope of how time and energy is spent in the math classroom. They do so in order to focus deeply on only the concepts that are prioritized in the standards.

Shift 2: Coherence: Principals and teachers carefully connect the learning within and across grades so that students can build new understanding onto foundations built in previous years.

Shift 3: Fluency: Students are expected to have speed and accuracy with simple calculations; teachers structure class time and/or homework time for students to memorize, through repetition, core functions.

Shift: 4 Deep Understanding: Students deeply understand and can operate easily within a math concept before moving on. They learn more than the trick to get the answer right. They learn the math.

Shift 5: Application: Students are expected to use math and choose the appropriate concept for application even when they are not prompted to do so.

Shift 6: Dual Intensity: Students are practicing and understanding. There is more than a balance between these two things in the classroom – both are occurring with intensity.

,What Instructional Supports Can I expect from the Consortia Assessments?,SBAC,"In addition to the results from the Summative/Adaptive assessments, Smarter Balanced will be providing two additional supports--Interim Comprehensive Assessments and Block Assessments:

Interim Comprehensive Assessments: Use the same blueprint as the summative assessments, assess the same range of standards, and provide scores on the same scale.

Interim Assessment Blocks: Focus on smaller sets of related concepts and provide more detailed information for instructional purposes. There are between five and seventeen blocks per subject per grade.

Smarter Balances is also providing its Digital Library, comprising is an online collection of instructional and professional learning resources contributed by educators for educators. These resources are aligned with the intent of the Common Core State Standards and will help educators implement the formative assessment process to improve teaching and learning. The Digital Library incorporates collaboration features providing educators opportunities to review resources using a star rating system  and share their expertise with colleagues across the country in online forums.",SBAC,http://www.smarterbalanced.org/k-12-education/teachers/,
,What Instructional Supports Can I expect from the Consortia Assessments?,PARCC,"PARCC is developing diagnostic and mid-year tools in reading, writing and mathematics, in addition to K-1 formative tools and speaking and listening tools. 

Diagnostic:  The overarching purpose of the PARCC diagnostic tools is to provide instructionally useful information to educators about how well students have learned, or how prepared they are to learn key content and skills tied to the standards.  

K-2 Formative:  PARCC envisions a set of innovative tools to support teachers at kindergarten and first grade.  As with the grades 2-8 diagnostic tools, the primary purpose for these tools is to provide educators with instructionally useful information related to how students demonstrate proficiencies (including in relation to content progressions), and to provide that information at an appropriate level of detail and specificity to supplement a teacher’s current understanding of student proficiency.  The formative tools will be incorporated into the curriculum and gather information about student learning in a way that seeks to be “invisible” to the student - that is, the formative experiences are designed to fit within the regular experience of young students.  

Mid-year/Interim Modules:  Designed to mirror the PARCC performance-based assessments, the mid-year/interim modules will provide students and educators the ability to work with constructed response and machine score-able items for formative purposes (student results will not be part of their PARCC score).   The modules are designed to inform curriculum, instruction and professional development. These tools will be performance-based and focus on difficult-to-assess standards, including writing effectively when analyzing texts in English language arts/literacy and applications/modeling and reasoning in mathematics. As with all of the non-summative tools, these are for optional use by states and districts.

Speaking and Listening Tools:  As described in the Common Core State Standards, the ability of students to proficiently engage in speaking and listening activities is critical for their long-term opportunities.  PARCC has developed claims for the speaking and listening tools that align with the standards.  ",PARRC,http://www.parcconline.org/non-summative-assessments,

,"What Does ""Depth of Knowledge (DOK) Mean""?",DOK Levels:  The Framework,"Webb (1997) developed a process and criteria for systematically analyzing the alignment between standards and standardized assessments. The model is based upon the assumption that curricular elements may all be categorized based upon the cognitive demands required to produce an acceptable response. Each grouping of tasks reflects a different level of cognitive expectation, or depth of knowledge, required to complete the task. It should be noted that the term knowledge, as it is used here, is intended to broadly encompass all forms of knowledge (i.e. procedural, declarative, etc.).  There are four levels include in this model, including:

1. Recall and Reproduction
2. Skills and Concepts
3. Short-Term Strategic Thinking
4. Extended Thinking

General guidelines for thinking about DOK level, specific to assessments, include: 

1. The DOK level assigned should reflect the level of work students are most commonly required to perform in order for the response to be deemed acceptable.

2. The DOK level should reflect the complexity of the cognitive processes demanded by the task outlined by the objective, rather than its difficulty. Ultimately the DOK level describes the kind of thinking required by a task, not whether or not the task is “difficult”. 

3. If there is a question regarding which of two levels a statement addresses, such as Level 1 or Level 2, or Level 2 or Level 3, it is appropriate to select the higher of the two levels. 

4. The DOK level should be assigned based upon the cognitive demands required by the central performance described in the objective. 

5. The objective’s central verb(s) alone is/are not sufficient information to assign a DOK level; the complexity of the task and/or information, conventional levels of prior knowledge for students at the grade level, and the mental processes used to satisfy the requirements set forth in the objective must also be consider.",Research and Curriculum Unit:  Mississippi State University,http://www.aps.edu/rda/documents/resources/Webbs_DOK_Guide.pdf,
,"What Does ""Depth of Knowledge (DOK) Mean""?",DOK Levels:  Defined,"There are four of DOK are defined as follows:

1. Recall and Reproduction:  Tasks that fall into this category involve basic tasks that require students to recall or reproduce knowledge and/or skills. The subject matter content at this particular level usually involves working with facts, terms and/or properties of objects. It may also involve use of simple procedures and/or formulas. There is little transformation or extended processing of the target knowledge required by the tasks that fall into this category.  Key words that often denote this particular level include: list, identify and define. A student answering a Level 1 item either knows the answer or does not; that is, the answer does not need to be “figured out” or “solved.”

2. Skills and Concepts:  Tasks that fall into this category 2 include the engagement of some mental processing beyond recalling or reproducing a response. This level generally requires students to contrast or compare people, places, events and concepts; convert information from one form to another; classify or sort items into meaningful categories ; describe or explain issues and problems, patterns , cause and effect, significance or impact, relationships, points of view or processes. A Level 2 “describe or explain” would require students to go beyond a description or explanation of recalled information to describe or explain a result or “how” or “why.” The learner should make use of information in a context different from the one in which it was learned.  Tasks that fall in this category involve working with or applying skills and/or concepts to tasks related to the field of study in a laboratory setting. The subject matter content at this particular level usually involves working with a set of principles, categories, heuristics, and protocols. At this level students are asked to transform/process target knowledge before responding. Example mental processes that often denote this particular level include: summarize, estimate, organize, classify, and infer.

3. Short-Term Strategic Thinking:  Tasks that fall into this category demand a short-term use of higher order thinking processes, such as analysis and evaluation, to solve real-world problems with predictable outcomes. Stating one’s reasoning is a key marker of tasks that fall into this particular category. The expectation established for tasks at this level tends to require coordination of knowledge and skill from multiple subject-matter areas to carry out processes and reach a solution in a project-based setting. Key processes that often denote this particular level include: analyze, explain and support with evidence, generalize, and create.
 
4. Extended Thinking:   Tasks that fall into this category demand extended use of higher order thinking processes such as synthesis, reflection, assessment and adjustment of plans over time. Students are engaged in conducting investigations to solve real-world problems with unpredictable outcomes. Employing and sustaining strategic thinking processes over a longer period of time to solve the problem is a key feature of curricular objectives that are assigned to this level. Key strategic thinking processes that denote this particular level include: synthesize,
reflect, conduct, and manage.",,,
,How Do I Make the Most Out of My Assessment Efforts?,Is There Such a Thing as a 'Formative Assessment'?,"In its purest sense, there is no such thing as a 'formative assessment'--that is, an assessment alone cannot be formative (ie., drive an instructional process) but only the actions you build around the results of that assessment can be formative.  As For Black and Wiliam note (authors of the siminal research Study, ""Inside the Blackbox"" note, For Black and Wiliam, formative assessment is not an instrument or an event, but a collection of practices with a common feature: they all lead to some action that improves learning. ",,,
,How Do I Make the Most Out of My Assessment Efforts?,Role of Teachers in a Formative Assessment Process--The Critical Questions and Answers,"In summarizing critical areas of the instructional process related to assessment Rick Stiggins highlights the importance of the role and actions teachers take within their classroom when using results from assessment.  As Stiggins notes, the strategies that can be employed to improve instruction revolved around answers to critical questions, including:

1. Who is and is not understanding the lesson?
2. What are this student’s strengths and needs?
3. What misconceptions do I need to address?
4. What feedback should I give students?
5. What adjustments should I make to instruction?
6. How should I group students?
7. What differentiation do I need to prepare?",,,
,How Do I Make the Most Out of My Assessment Efforts?,Stiggins:  7  Strategies to Improve My Formative Assessment Outcomes,"Stiggins identifies 7 strategies to improve student outcomes based upon formative assessment, surrounded around 3 critical questions:  1) Where am I going? 2) Where am I now; and 3) How can I close the gap?.  The strategies related to those critical questions are as follows:

1. Where Am I Going? 
Strategy 1: Provide students with a clear and understandable vision of the learning target. Motivation and achievement both increase when instruction is guided by clearly defined targets. Activities that help students answer the question, “What’s the learning?” set the stage for all further formative assessment actions. 
Strategy 2: Use examples and models of strong and weak work. Carefully chosen examples of the range of quality can create and refine students’ understanding of the learning goal by helping students answer the questions, “What defines quality work?” and “What are some problems to avoid?”.

2.  Where Am I Now?
Strategy 3: Offer regular descriptive feedback. Effective feedback shows students where they are on their path to attaining the intended learning. It answers for students the questions, “What are my strengths?”; “What do I need to work on?”; and “Where did I go wrong and what can I do about it?  Strategy 4: Teach students to self-assess and set goals. The information provided in effective feedback models the kind of evaluative thinking we want students to be able to do themselves. Strategy 4 teaches students to identify their strengths and weaknesses and to set goals for further learning. It helps them answer the questions, “What am I good at?”; “What do I need to work on?”; and “What should I do next?”  

3. How Can I Close the Gap? 
Strategy 5: Design lessons to focus on one learning target or aspect of quality at a time. When assessment information identifies a need, we can adjust instruction to target that need. In this strategy, we scaffold learning by narrowing the focus of a lesson to help students master a specific learning goal or to address specific misconceptions or problems. 
Strategy 6: Teach students focused revision. This is a companion to Strategy 5—when a concept, skill, or competence proves difficult for students, we can let them practice it in smaller segments, and give them feedback on just the aspects they are practicing. This strategy allows students to revise their initial work with a focus on a manageable number of learning targets or aspects of quality. 
Strategy 7: Engage students in self-reflection, and let them keep track of and share their learning. Long-term retention and motivation increase when students track, reflect on, and communicate about their learning. In this strategy, students look back on their journey, reflecting on their learning and sharing their achievement with others. The seven strategies are not a recipe to be followed step by step, although they do build on one another. Rather, they are a collection of actions that will strengthen students’ sense of self-efficacy (belief that effort will lead to improvement), their motivation to try, and ultimately, their achievement. They represent a use of assessment information that differs from the traditional practice of associating assessment with test, and test with grade. These assessment practices will not result in more grades in the gradebook. Rather, they ask us to think more broadly about what assessment is and what it is capable of accomplishing.",,,
,What Does the 'Every Student Succeed Act' (ESSA) Mean for Me?,Accountability,"Under ESSA, states are accountable for focusing resources on low-performing schools and traditionally underserved students who consistently demonstrate low academic performance.  Included in the requirements are:

1. Goals for Student Achievement:  States must set long-term student achievement goals with measurements of interim progress.

2. Goals for High School Graduation Rates:  States must set a long-term goal for the four-year high school graduation rate with measurements of interim progress. States may set goals for extended-year high school graduation rates, but those goals must be higher than the four-year
graduation rate goal.

3. Accountability Indicators:  Accountability indicators vary for Elementatry/Middles Schools as compared to High Schools:
          Elementary and middle schools:
               • test scores
               • a “measure of student growth” or other academic indicator that allows for meaningful differentiation among student groups
               • English language proficiency
               • at least one indicator of school quality or success that allows for meaningful differentiation among student performance

          High schools:
               • test scores (In addition to this, states may use student growth based on annual assessments.)
               • four-year graduation rate (In addition to this, states may use an extended-year graduation rate.)
               • English language proficiency 
               • At least one indicator of school quality or success that allows for meaningful differentiation among student groups

4. Schools Identified for Comprehensive Reform Based on Performance of All Students:  States must identify the lowest performing
5 percent of Title I schools for comprehensive support. States must also identify all high schools with a graduation rate at or below 67 percent for comprehensive support.  Finally, States must identify these low-performing schools and low-graduation-rate high
schools at least once every three years.",Alliance for Excellent Education,http://all4ed.org/ESSA/,
,What Does the 'Every Student Succeed Act' (ESSA) Mean for Me?,Assessment,"ESSA supports states in implementing high-quality assessments by providing new assessment flexibility, funding, and a new pilot program. These new policies will support teachers in using assessments to foster deeper learning among students, including the ability to master core academic content, think critically and solve complex problems, and communicate effectively.

1. Annual Statewide Assessments:  ESSA requires states to administer an annual assessment of students in grades three through eight, and once in high school, in math and English/language arts.

2. New Assessment Flexibility:  ESSA includes several provisions intended to strengthen the quality of state assessments:
          •  Assessments may be delivered, in part, in the form of projects, portfolios, and extended-performance tasks.
          •  In high schools, districts may implement nationally recognized assessments that meet state and federal technical standards
and are approved by “peer review” and the state.
          •  States may, but are not required to, set a target limit on the aggregate amount of time spent on assessment administration.
3. Funding:  ESSA maintains federal funding to support state assessments, authorizing up to $378 million annually. States may use these funds to develop and implement the annual assessments required under the law. In addition, states and districts may use
funds to develop balanced assessment systems (i.e., formative, interim, and summative assessments) and competency-based
assessments. Furthermore, states may use federal funds to conduct assessment audits of state and district assessments to
ensure they are necessary and of high quality.
4. Innovative Assessment Pilot:  ESSA allows up to seven states, and a consortia not to exceed four states, to implement an innovative assessment and accountability pilot. This pilot may include the use of competency- or performance-based assessments for accountability purposes, and removes the requirement for annual statewide assessments to be used for
accountability purposes.
5. Opt-Out:   At least 95 percent of students and 95 percent of each group of traditionally underserved students must be assessed. This provision aims to ensure that students will participate in annual statewide assessments",Alliance for Excellent Education,http://all4ed.org/ESSA/,
,What Does the 'Every Student Succeed Act' (ESSA) Mean for Me?,High Schools,"Under ESSA, states and districts are responsible for supporting and improving the quality of low-performing high schools.

1. High School Graduation Rate Goals:  For all students and student subgroups, states must set longterm goals for the four-year high school graduation rate with measurements of interim progress. States may set goals for extended-year graduation rates (e.g., five-year or six-year graduation rate), but these goals must be higher than the fouryear graduation rate goal.
2. Low-Graduation-Rate High Schools:  At least once every three years, states must identify high schools with graduation rates at or below 67 percent for comprehensive, locally-determined, evidence-based intervention. These schools have up to four years to meet state-set criteria that would allow them to exit the comprehensive support and improvement status.  If these schools do not meet these criteria they must implement more rigorous state-determined interventions. In addition, districts may allow students in these schools to transfer to other public schools in the district. 
3. Funding for High Schools:  Currently, high schools receive 10 percent of Title I funding; however, they enroll nearly one-quarter of students from lowincome families.  In addition, there are 3,102 high schools that have a poverty rate of at least 50 percent, yet they do not receive Title I funds.   To address this inequity, ESSA allows districts to target Title I funds to high schools. Districts are allowed to lower the priority threshold to receive Title I funds from 75 percent to 50 percent for high schools. The priority threshold to receive Title I funds remains at 75 percent for elementary and middle schools.
4. School Improvement Funding:  ESSA eliminates the School Improvement Grants program.  However, it requires states to utilize 7 percent of their Title I funds to support school improvement activities. In addition, states may use 3 percent of their Title I funding to provide “direct student services,” which may include Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and other advanced course work; career and technical education that leads to an industry-recognized credential; credit recovery; and personalized learning.
5. High School Program:  ESSA eliminates the High School Graduation Initiative (HSGI) included in the No Child Left Behind Act. HSGI was the only program dedicated to high school dropout prevention and recovery. However, ESSA creates a new grant program for
states and districts called the Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grant program. Funds from this new program may be
used for dropout prevention as well as a variety of other activities related to supporting a well-rounded education, improving
school conditions, and digital literacy.
6. State and District Plans:  State plans must describe how the state will work with districts to provide for the effective transition of students from middle school to high school and from high school to postsecondary education. Strategies for doing so may include integrating rigorous academics, career and technical education, and work-based learning; dual enrollment; and coordination with institutions of higher education and employers. In addition, district plans may use Title I funds to support experiential and work-based learning opportunities that provide students with in-depth interactions with industry professionals and academic credit. Plans also may support dual enrollment, early college high schools, and career counseling. ",Alliance for Excellent Education,http://all4ed.org/ESSA/,
,What Does the 'Every Student Succeed Act' (ESSA) Mean for Me?,Teachers and School Leaders,"Under ESSA, states and districts are responsible for improving the quality and effectiveness of teachers, principals, and other school leaders in increasing student academic achievement.

1. Eliminates “Highly Qualified Teacher” Requirement:  ESSA eliminates the highly qualified teacher (HQT) provision that
existed under the No Child Left Behind Act requiring that students from low-income families and students of color not be taught by
ineffective, inexperienced, unqualified, or out-of-field teachers at higher rates than their peers. The bill does not set a minimum bar of entry into the teaching profession.
2. Student Access to Effective Teaching:  ESSA replaces the HQT provision with the following requirements:
          • School districts must describe how they will identify and address any disparities that result in students from lowincome
families and students of color being taught by ineffective, inexperienced, unqualified, or out-of-field teachers at higher rates than other students.*
          • States must collect and publicly report data on these disparities.*
          • State plans must describe how students from low-income families and students of color will not be served at disproportionate rates by ineffective, out-of-field, or inexperienced teachers.*
          • School districts must have mechanisms to notify parents regarding the professional qualifications of their child’s teacher.
          • States may use federal professional development funds to increase access to effective teachers for students from  low income families and students of color.
*Does not apply to students with disabilities and English language learners
3. Professional Development:  ESSA slightly decreases federal funding for professional development activities. For Fiscal Year 2015, the U.S. Congress appropriated $2.35 billion for these activities, while ESSA sets the authorization level at $2.30 billion. ESSA authorizes federal funding for states and school districts to provide professional development activities that support improving teacher and school leader effectiveness. These activities include reforming teacher/leader certification requirements (including ensuring that teachers have the necessary subject-matter knowledge and teaching skills and may include a teacher performance assessment); induction, residency, and mentoring programs; and efforts to increase recruitment and retention, such as career ladders. States may use professional development funding for leaders to develop the instructional leadership skills necessary for teachers to teach to the state standards and help students meet those standards. This may include supporting teachers in using data and assessments to improve classroom practice; developing and implementing instructional practices that support dual or concurrent enrollment programs; and integrating rigorous academics, career and technical education, and work-based learning, such as using common planning time to help prepare students for postsecondary education and the workforce.
4. Teacher and Leader Evaluations:  States may use federal professional development funds to implement teacher and leader evaluation systems based on student achievement, growth, and multiple measures of performance and to inform professional development; however, states are not required to implement such systems.

,What Does the 'Every Student Succeed Act' (ESSA) Mean for Me?,Standards,"Under ESSA States are required to adopt “challenging” academic standards. That could be the Common Core State Standards, but doesn’t have to be.  The U.S. Secretary of Education is expressly prohibited from forcing or even encouraging states to pick a particular set of standards (including the common core).  Further, States are required to adopt challenging statewide academic content standards and statewide academic achievement standards that apply to all public schools and public school students in the
state in, at minimum, math, reading/language arts, and science. The state must set at least three levels of achievement standards (e.g., Basic, Proficient, and Advanced).
          • These standards must be aligned with entrance requirements for credit-bearing coursework in the public higher education system in the state, as well as with relevant career and technical education standards.
          • The same standards must apply to all students in the state, except that states are allowed to set
alternative achievement standards for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities.  Alternative achievement standards must be aligned to ensure that a student who meets these standards is on track to pursue postsecondary education or employment.
          • States must also put in place standards for English-language proficiency that address speaking, listening, reading, and writing, and are aligned with the state’s academic standards.

,How do I Integrate Assessment into My Day-to-Day Instructional Process?,Formative Assessment:  A Definition,"What Does a Formative Assessment Process Look Like?

Formative assessment is an active and intentional learning process that partners the teacher and the students to continuously and systematically gather evidence of learning with the express goal of improving student achievement. Intentional learning refers to cognitive processes that have learning as a goal rather than an incidental outcome (Bereiter & Scardamalia, 1989). Teachers and their students actively and intentionally engage in the formative assessment process when they work together to do the following (Brookhart, 2006):

     a.  Focus on learning goals;
     b.  Take stock of where current work is in relation to the goal;
     c.  Take action to move closer to the goal

The primary purpose of formative assessment is to improve learning, not merely to audit it. It is assessmentfor learning rather than assessment of learning. Formative assessment is both an ""instructional tool"" that teachers and their students ""use while learning is occurring"" and ""an accountability tool to determine if learning has occurred"" (National Education Association, 2003, p. 3). In other words, to be ""formative,"" assessments must inform the decisions that teachers and their students make minute by minute in the classroom. ",ASCD,http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/109031/chapters/The-Lay-of-the-Land@-Essential-Elements-of-the-Formative-Assessment-Process.aspx,
,How do I Integrate Assessment into My Day-to-Day Instructional Process?,"Formative Assessment:  A Process, not a Thing","Formative Assessment:  As a Process:

Formative assessment is a planned process in which assessment-elicited evidence of students' status is used by teachers to adjust their ongoing instructional procedures or by students to adjust their current learning tactics.

     a.  Formative assessment is not a test but a process—a planned process involving a number of different activities.
     b.  One of those activities is the use of assessments, both formal and informal, to elicit evidence regarding students' status: the degree to which a particular student has mastered a particular skill or body of knowledge.
     c.  Based on this evidence, teachers adjust their ongoing instructional activities or students adjust the procedures they're currently using to try to learn whatever they're trying to learn.

A Planned Process: Formative assessment involves a series of carefully considered, distinguishable acts on the part of teachers or students or both. Some of those acts involve educational assessments, but the assessments play a role in the process—they are not the process itself. An educator who refers to ""a formative test"" has not quite grasped the concept, because there's no such thing. There are tests that can be used as part of the multistep, formative assessment process, but each of those tests is only a part of the process.

Assessment-Elicited Evidence: The adjustment decisions teachers and students make during the formative assessment process must be based not on whim but on evidence of the students' current level of mastery with respect to certain skills or bodies of knowledge. Accordingly, one component of the formative assessment process is for teachers to adjust their ongoing instructional activities.  It's worth stressing that because the formative assessment process deals with ongoing instruction, any teacher-made modifications in instructional activities must focus on students' mastery of the curricular aims currently being pursued. It's not a matter of looking at test data and deciding to try a new approach next time; it's a matter of doing something different (or differently) now.

Students' Learning Tactic Adjustments: Within the formative assessment process, students also take a look at assessment evidence and, if need be, make changes in how they're trying to learn. Consider, for example, a high school student who is working toward becoming a better public speaker by practicing a particular speech many times before a mirror. That repeated, solo-mirror practice is the student's learning tactic; based on assessment evidence, this tactic may or may not need adjustment.",James Popham,"http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/108018/chapters/Formative-Assessment@-Why,-What,-and-Whether.aspx",
,How do I Integrate Assessment into My Day-to-Day Instructional Process?,"Assessment 'FOR', not 'OF', Learning","Assessment FOR Learning:

Assessment for learning turns day-to-day assessment into a teaching and learning process that enhances (instead of merely monitoring) student learning. Extensive research conducted around the world shows that by consistently applying the principles of assessment for learning, we can produce impressive gains in student achievement, especially for struggling learners (Black & Wiliam, 1998).

Assessment for learning begins when teachers share achievement targets with students, presenting those expectations in student-friendly language accompanied by examples of exemplary student work. Then, frequent self-assessments provide students (and teachers) with continual access to descriptive feedback in amounts they can manage effectively without being overwhelmed. Thus, students can chart their trajectory toward the transparent achievement targets their teachers have established.

The students' role is to strive to understand what success looks like, to use feedback from each assessment to discover where they are now in relation to where they want to be, and to determine how to do better the next time. As students become increasingly proficient, they learn to generate their own descriptive feedback and set goals for what comes next on their journey.

Teachers and students are partners in the assessment for learning process. For example, teachers might have students study samples of work that vary in quality and collaborate in creating their own student-friendly version of a performance assessment scoring rubric. Or students might create practice versions of multiple-choice tests that parallel the content of an upcoming final exam, which they can then use to analyze their own strengths and weaknesses and to focus their final preparation for that exam. Students can accumulate evidence of their learning in growth portfolios. They can also become partners with teachers in communicating about their own learning successes by leading their parent/teacher conferences.

Assessment for learning provides both students and teachers with understandable information in a form they can use immediately to improve performance. In this context, students become both self-assessors and consumers of assessment information. As they experience and understand their own improvement over time, learners begin to sense that success is within reach if they keep trying. This process can put them on a winning streak and keep them there.

When we use assessment for learning, assessment becomes far more than merely a one-time event stuck onto the end of an instructional unit. It becomes a series of interlaced experiences that enhance the learning process by keeping students confident and focused on their progress, even in the face of occasional setbacks.

The goal of assessment for learning is not to eliminate failure, but rather to keep failure from becoming chronic and thus inevitable in the mind of the learner. Duke University basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski has pointed out that the key to winning is to avoid losing twice in a row (Kanter, 2004, p. 251). He meant that if you lose once and fix it, you can remain confident. Losing twice, though, can raise questions, crack that confidence, and make recovery more difficult. So when learners suffer a failure, we must get them back to success as quickly as possible to restore their confidence in their capabilities. This is the emotional dynamic of assessment for learning.",Rick Stiggins,http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/may07/vol64/num08/Assessment-Through-the-Student's-Eyes.aspx,
